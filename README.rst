Chinese RFID Access Control Library
========================

This library allows you to add and remove users from the cheapest and most common RFID access control system. This allows you to integrate the access control system with your software to do things like remove an user when they have failed to pay their bill. 

The goal of this project is to provide a cheap, out-of-the-box solution for RFID Access Control.

This library currently only works with a single type of controller which goes by a wide variety of model numbers. You can know which one to buy by looking for one that looks like this:
